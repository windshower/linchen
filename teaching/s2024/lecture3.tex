\maketitle

In this lecture, we give a quick review of the theory of algebraic groups. This theory is analogous to that of complex Lie groups, but the techniques are more algebraic and some proofs are subtler\footnote{Especially if one allows positive-characteristic or non-algebraic-closed base field $k$.}. Standard textbooks include: \cite{B}, \cite{H} and \cite{Sp}. See \cite{M} for a modern treatment of this theory, which is also my favourite.



\section{Algebraic Groups}

\begin{defn}
	An \textbf{algebraic group} over $k$ is a finite type $k$-scheme $G$ equipped with a group structure, i.e., a multiplication map $m:G\mt G\to G$ subject to axioms similar to those for an abstract group.

	Homomorphisms between algebraic groups are defined in the obvious way. Let $\Grp_k$ be the category of algebraic groups.
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
	As in the study of abstract groups, the unit and the inversion maps are determined by the multiplication map. We denote them respectively by:
	\[
		e: \pt \to G,\; \sigma: G\to G,
	\]
	where $\pt:=\Spec(k)$.
\end{rem}


\begin{constr}
	Let $G$ be an algebraic group. For any commutative $k$-algebra $A$, write
	\[
		G(A):= \Hom( \Spec(A),G )
	\]
	be the set of maps $\Spec(A)\to G$ between $k$-schemes. The group structure on $G$ induces a group structure on $G(A)$.

	Note that for $A\to B$, we have a homomorphism $G(A) \to G(B)$. Hence we obtain a functor
	\[
		G(-): \CAlg_k \to \Grp
	\]
	from the category of commutative $k$-algebras to the category of (abstract) groups. By the Yoneda lemma, the algebraic group $G$ is determined by this functor.
\end{constr}

\begin{exam}
	The \textbf{additive group} $\mBG_\mba$ is defined such that $\mBG_\mba(A) = A$, viewed as a commutative group under addition. The underlying $k$-scheme is the affine line $\mBA^1$.
\end{exam}

\begin{exam}
	The \textbf{multplicative group} $\GL_1 = \mBG_\mbm$ is defined such that $\mBG_\mbm(A) = A^\times$, i.e. the subset of unit elements in $A$, viewed as a commutative group under multiplication. The underlying $k$-scheme is $\mBA^1 \setminus 0$, i.e., the affine line with the origin removed.
\end{exam}

\begin{exam}
	One can define algebraic groups $G:=\GL_n$, $\SL_n$, $\mathsf{SO}_n$, etc. such that $G(A)$ is the group of matrices of the corresponding type with coefficients in $A$. 
\end{exam}

\begin{exam}
	One can define the algebraic group $\mathsf{PGL}_n$ such that $\mCO_{ \mathsf{PGL}_n }$ is a subring of $\mCO_{\GL_n}$\footnote{Warning: $\mathsf{PGL}_n(A)\neq \GL_n(A)/\GL_1(A)$ for general $A$. In fact, viewed as functors in $A$, the LHS is the sheafification of the RHS in the fpqc topology.}.
\end{exam}

\begin{rem}
	Not every functor $\CAlg_k \to \Grp$ comes from an algebraic group. For example, any $k$-vector space $V$ defines a functor
	\[
		\GL_V(-): \CAlg_k \to \Grp
	\]
	that sends $A$ to the group of $A$-linear automorphisms of $A\ot V$. This functor is not represented by an algebraic group unless $V$ is finite-dimensional.
\end{rem}

\section{Hopf algebras}
	From now on, we assume $G$ is affine\footnote{Any affine algebraic group over field of characteristic $0$ is smooth.}\footnote{Projective algebraic groups, a.k.a., abelian varieties, are also important and play a central role in modern mathematics.}.

\begin{constr}
	An affine algebraic group $G$ is determined by its ring of functions $\mCO_G$. The maps $m: G\mt G \to G$ and $e: \pt \to G$ correspond to homomorphisms between algebras
	\[
		\Delta:\mCO_G \to \mCO_G\ot \mCO_G, \; \epsilon: \mCO_G \to k,
	\]
	which are called the \textbf{comultiplication} and \textbf{counit} maps of $\mCO_G$. Together with the usual multiplication and unit maps of $\mCO_G$, we obtain a \textbf{bialgebra} $(\mCO_G, \cdot,\Delta)$. 

	Note that this bialgebra is commutative but not cocommutative unless $G$ is so.

	The inverse map $\sigma:G\to G$ corresponds to a homomorphism $S: \mCO_G\to \mCO_G$, which is called the \textbf{antipode} of $\mCO_G$. This makes $\mCO_G$ into a commutative \textbf{Hopf algebra}. 
\end{constr}

\begin{rem}
	A Hopf algebra is a bialgebra $A$ equipped with an antipode map $S:A\to A$ subject to a certain axiom. For our purposes, it is less useful to memorize this axiom than to imagine it amounts to say ``$\Spec(A)$''\footnote{Note however that this does not make sense if $A$ is not commutative.} has an inversion map.
\end{rem}

\begin{exam}
	For $G=\mBG_\mba$, we have $\mCO_G=k[t]$ and
	\[
		\Delta(t) = t\otimes 1+1\otimes t ,\; \epsilon(f) = f(0),\; S(f)(t) = f(-t).
	\]
\end{exam}

\begin{exam}
	For $G=\mBG_\mbm$, we have $\mCO_G=k[t,t^{-1}]$ and
	\[
		\Delta(t) = t\otimes t ,\; \epsilon(f) = f(1),\; S(f)(t) = f(t^{-1}).
	\]
\end{exam}


\begin{exam}
	The universal enveloping algebra $U(\mfg)$ of any Lie algebra is a Hopf algebra. The comultiplication $\Delta:U(\mfg) \to U(\mfg)\ot U(\mfg)$ is determined by $\Delta(x) = x\otimes 1 + 1\otimes x$, $x\in \mfg \subset U(\mfg)$ and its compatibility with the multiplication. Similarly, the antipode is determined by $S(x)=-x$, $x\in \mfg$.

	The Hopf algebra $U(\mfg)$ is cocommutative but not commutative unless $\mfg$ is abelian.
\end{exam}

\begin{rem}
	Using the Hopf algebra structure on $U(\mfg)$, the tensor product structure in $\mfg\hmod$ can be defined as follows. Let $V_1$ and $V_2$ be left $U(\mfg)$-modules. Their tensor product $V_1\ot V_2$ is naturally a $U(\mfg)\ot U(\mfg)$-module. Restricting along $\Delta$, we can view $V_1\ot V_2$ as a $U(\mfg)$-module.
\end{rem}



\begin{rem}
	There are also interesting Hopf algebras that are neither commutative nor cocommutative. For example, \emph{quantum algebras} are such gadgets. See \cite{L} for a standard textbook.
\end{rem}


\section{Tangent spaces}

	As in the theory of Lie groups, the tangent space of an algebraic group at its unit is a Lie algebra. To desribe this, let us review the definition of tangent spaces in algebraic geometry.

\begin{defn}
	Let $X$ be any $k$-scheme and $x\in X$ be a $k$-point, i.e., a map $x: \Spec(k) \to X$. The \textbf{tangent space} of $X$ at $x$, denoted by $T_xX$, is the \emph{set} of dotted arrows making the following diagram commute:
	\[
		\xymatrix{
			\Spec(k) \ar[r]^-x \ar[d]
			& X \\
			\Spec(k[\epsilon]/\epsilon^2). \ar@{.>}[ru]
		}
	\]
	Here the vertical map is given by the homomorphism $k[\epsilon]/\epsilon^2 \to k$, $\epsilon\mapsto 0$.

	Elements in $T_xX$ are called \textbf{tangent vectors} of $X$ at $x$.
\end{defn}


	Tangent vectors are related to \emph{derivations}. Let us review its definition in the algebraic setting.

\begin{defn}
	Let $A$ be a $k$-algebra and $M$ be an $A$-module. A \textbf{$k$-derivation} of $A$ into $M$ is a $k$-linear map $D:A\to M$ satisfying the \textbf{Lebniz rule}
	\[
		D(f\cdot g) = f\cdot D (g) + g\cdot D (f).
	\]
	Let $\Der(A,M)$ be the set of such $k$-derivations. This is naturally an $A$-module.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	Let $X$ be a $k$-scheme and $\mCM$ be an $\mCO_X$-module. A \textbf{$k$-derivation} of $\mCO_X$ into $\mCM$ is a $k$-linear morphism $D:\mCO_X \to \mCM$ such that for any open subscheme $U\subset X$, $D(U): \mCO_X(U) \to \mCM(U)$ is a $k$-derivation. Let $\Der(\mCO_X,\mCM)$ be the space of $k$-derivations.

\end{defn}

\begin{constr}
	Let $X=\Spec(A)$ be an affine scheme and $x:\Spec(k) \to X$ be given by a homomorphism $\phi:A\to k$. View $k$ as an $A$-module via this homomorphism and denote it by $k_x$. For any $D\in \Der(A,k_x)$, the map 
	\[
		A\to k[\epsilon]/\epsilon^2,\; f\mapsto \phi(f)+D(f)\epsilon
	\]
	is a homomorphism and thereby gives a map $\Spec(k[\epsilon]/\epsilon^2) \to X$, which is an element in $T_x X$. It is easy to see this gives a bijection
	\[
		\Der(A,k_x) \simeq T_x X.
	\]
	In particular, we obtain an $A$-module structure on $T_x X$. Note that the action of $A$ factors through $A\surj k_x$.

	For general $k$-scheme, the above construction gives a bijection
	\[
		\Der(\mCO_X,k_x) \simeq T_x X,
	\]
	where $k_x$ is viewed as the skyscrapter sheaf at $x$. Indeed, this follows from the obvious fact that $T_xX$ only depends on a Zariski neighborhood of $x$ in $X$.
\end{constr}

\begin{constr}
	Let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism between $k$-schemes. Let $x\in X$ and $y:=f(x)\in Y$ be $k$-points. There is an obvious $k$-linear map
	\[
		df: T_x X \to T_y Y
	\]
	given by composing with $f$. We call it the \textbf{differential} of $f$.
\end{constr}

	We have the following obvious result:

\begin{lem}
	\label{lem-tangent-product}
 	Let $X$ and $Y$ be $k$-schemes. Let $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$ be $k$-points. For $\partial_1\in T_x X$ and $\partial_2\in T_yY$, write $\partial_1\oplus\partial_2\in T_{(x,y)}(X\mt Y)$ for the map
 	\[
 		\Spec(k[\epsilon]/\epsilon^2) \xrightarrow{(\partial_1,\partial_2)} X\mt  Y.
 	\]
 	Then the map
 	\begin{equation}
 		\label{eqn-sum-tangent}
 		T_x X \times T_y Y \to T_{(x,y)}(X\mt Y),\; (\partial_1,\partial_2) \mapsto \partial_1\oplus\partial_2
 	\end{equation}
 	induces an isomorphism $T_x X\oplus T_y Y = T_{(x,y)}(X\mt Y)$.

\end{lem}


\section{Lie Algebras and Algebraic Groups}

\begin{notn}
	Let $G$ be an algebraic group. Define
	\[
		\Lie(G):= T_e G.
	\]
\end{notn}

\begin{exam}
	For $G=\GL_n$, we have $\Lie(\GL_n) \simeq \gl_n$. In particular, $\Lie(\GL_n)$ is naturally a Lie algebra. We have similar results for other classical subgroups of $\GL_n$.
\end{exam}

\begin{rem}
	Consider the multiplication map $m: G\mt G\to G$ and its differential $dm: \Lie(G\mt G)\to \Lie (G)$. Via the identification $\Lie(G)\oplus \Lie(G)\simeq \Lie(G\mt G)$, we obtain a binary operation on $\Lie(G)$:
	\[
		\Lie(G)\oplus \Lie(G) \simeq \Lie(G\mt G) \xrightarrow{dm} \Lie(G).
	\]
	By definition, this binary operation is associative and $0\in \Lie(G)$ is the unit of it. Hence it sends $(\partial_1,\partial_2)$ to $\partial_1+\partial_2$. This is the algebraic analogue of the formula $\exp(t u)\cdot \exp(t v) = \exp(t (u+v))(1 + O(t^2))$, $u,v\in \Lie(G)$ that appears in the study of Lie groups.

	In particular, we have a short exact sequence of groups:
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eqn-SES-Lie}
		0 \to \Lie(G) \to G(k[\epsilon]) \to G(k) \to 0,
	\end{equation}
	where the group structure on $\Lie(G)$ is given by $(\partial_1,\partial_2)\mapsto \partial_1+\partial_2$.
\end{rem}

\begin{thm}	
	There is a canonical functor $\Grp_k \to \Lie_k$ sending $G$ to $\Lie(G)$ equipped with a natural Lie bracket, such that for $G=\GL_n$, the Lie bracket on $\Lie(\GL_n)$ is given by that on $\gl_n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{rem}
	There are several equivalent ways to construct the Lie bracket on $\Lie(G)$. Below are two of them:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
			The Hopf algebra approach: given $\partial_1,\partial_2\in \Lie(G)$, viewed as $k$-derivations $\mCO_G \to k_e$, consider the composition\footnote{For non-affine $G$, we use the morphisms between $\mCO_X$-modules $\mCO_G \xrightarrow{\Delta} \mathsf{mult}_*(\mCO_G \ot \mCO_G) \xrightarrow{ \partial_1 \ot\partial_2 -\partial_2\ot\partial_1 }\mathsf{mult}_*(k_e \ot k_e) \simeq k_e$.}
			\[
				\mCO_G \xrightarrow{\Delta} \mCO_G \ot \mCO_G \xrightarrow{ \partial_1 \ot\partial_2 -\partial_2\ot\partial_1 } k_e.
			\]
			One can show this is also a $k$-derivation. Then we define $[\partial_1, \partial_2]\in \Lie(G)$ to be the element corresponding to this $k$-derivation. The axioms of Hopf algebras imply this is indeed a Lie bracket. This is the algebraic analogue of the formula $\exp(t u)\cdot \exp(t v)\cdot \exp(-t u)\cdot \exp(-t v) = \exp(t^2 [u,v])(1+ O(t^3))$, $u,v\in \Lie(G)$ that appears in the study of Lie groups.

		\item
			The adjoint representation approach: the isomorphism $\Lie(G)\simeq \Der(\mCO_G,k_e)$ can be generalized to $\Lie(G)\ot R\simeq \Der(\mCO_G,R_e)$ that are functorial in $R\in \CAlg_k$. It follows that the short exact sequence \eqref{eqn-SES-Lie} can be generalized to short exact sequences
			\[
				0 \to \Lie(G)\ot R \to G(R[\epsilon]) \to G(R) \to 0
			\]
			that are functorial in $R$. Note that we have a canonical splitting $G(R) \to G(R[\epsilon])$ induced by the \emph{embedding} $R\to R[\epsilon]$. These splittings provide adjoint actions of $ G(R)$ on $\Lie(G)\ot R$ that are functorial in $R$. In other words, we have a homomorphism between algebraic groups:
			\begin{equation}
				\label{eqn-Adjiont-action}
				\Ad: G\to \GL_{\Lie(G)}.
			\end{equation}
			The differential of this homomorphism at the unit element $e$ gives a $k$-linear map
			\[
				\ad: \Lie(G) \to \gl_{\Lie(G)}.
			\]
			Then we define $[\alpha_1,\alpha_2]:= \ad(\alpha_1)(\alpha_2)$. One can show this is indeed a Lie bracket. Note that by construction $\ad$ is indeed the adjoint presentation of $\Lie(G)$.
	\end{itemize}

\end{rem}

\begin{rem}
	The functor $\Grp_k \to \Lie_k$ is unique if stated properly. See \cite[Theorem 10.23]{M}.
\end{rem}

\begin{warn}
	It is not true that every Lie algebra can be obtained from algebraic groups. See \cite[I, \S 5, Exercise 6]{Bou} for a counterexample.
\end{warn}

\begin{rem}
	Let $G$ be an affine algebraic group and $\mfg:=\Lie(G)$ be its Lie algebra. The Hopf algebras $\mCO_G$ and $U(\mfg)$ are related as follows.

	Consider the dual $U(\mfg)^*:=\Hom_k(U(\mfg),k)$ as a topological vector space\footnote{For a vector space $V$ equipped with the discrete topology, the dual $V^*$ is equipped with the weakest topology such that for any finite-dimensional subspace $V_0\subset V$, the map $V^*\to V_0^*$ is continuous. Here $V_0^*$ is equipped with the discrete topology. Equivalently, we can define $V^*$ as an object in the pro-category $\mathsf{Pro}(\Vect_{k,\mathsf{fd}})$ of finite dimensional vector spaces.}. The cocommutative Hopf algebra structure on $U(\mfg)$ induces a commutative topological Hopf algebra structure on it\footnote{Here we must use the \emph{complete tensor product} $U(\mfg)^* \hat\otimes U(\mfg)^*$ instead of the usual tensor product. By design, this is the dual of $U(\mfg)\ot U(\mfg)$.
	}.

	On the other hand, consider the maximal ideal $\mfm\subset \mCO_G$ corresponding to the unit point $e:\pt \to G$. Let $\hat\mCO_G$ be the $\mfm$-adic completion of $\mCO_G$. The commutative Hopf algebra structure on $\mCO_G$ induces a commutative topological Hopf algebra structure on it.

	We have
	\[
		U(\mfg)^* \simeq \hat\mCO_G
	\]
	as commutative topological Hopf algebras such that $(\mbF^{\le k}U(\mfg))^* \simeq  \hat\mCO_G/\mfm^k\hat\mCO_G$. Note that this gives another way to define the Lie bracket on $\Lie(G)$.
\end{rem}

\begin{exam}
	Note that the Lie algebras of $\mBG_\mba$ and $\mBG_\mbm$ are isomorphic, it follows that $\hat\mCO_{\mBG_\mba} \simeq k[\![t]\!]$ and $\hat\mCO_{\mBG_\mbm}=k[\![t-1]\!]$ are isomorphic. Up to a scaler, this isomorphism is given by
	\[
		k[\![t-1]\!]\to k[\![t]\!],\; f\mapsto f(\exp(t)).
	\]
	Note that given a power series $a_0+a_1(t-1)+a_2(t-1)^2+\cdots$, the series $a_0+a_1(\exp(t)-1)+a_2(\exp(t)-1)^2+\cdots$ indeed converges in the $t$-adic topology.
	
\end{exam}

\section{Representations of Algebraic Groups}

In this section, $G$ is an affine algebraic group.

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{representation of $G$}, or equivalently a \textbf{$G$-module} is a $k$-vector space $V$ equipped with a natural transformation $G(-)\to \GL_V(-)$ as functors $\CAlg_k \to \Grp$.

	Let $V$ and $W$ be $G$-modules, a \textbf{$G$-linear map} $\phi:V\to W$ is a $k$-linear map such that for any $A\in \CAlg_k$, the following diagram commutes
	\[
		\xymatrix{
			G(A) \ar[r] \ar[d] &
			\GL_V(A) \ar[d]^-{\phi\circ-} \\
			\GL_W(A) \ar[r]^-{-\circ \phi} &
			\Hom_A( A\ot V,A\ot W ).
		}
	\]

	Let $\Rep(G)$ be the category of $G$-modules.
\end{defn}

\begin{exam}
	Any $V$ can be equipped with a trivial $G$-module structure such that the homomorphisms $G(A) \to \GL_V(A)$ are trivial.
\end{exam}

\begin{exam}
	The homomorphism \eqref{eqn-Adjiont-action} defines a $G$-module structure on its Lie algebra $\Lie(G)$. We call it the \textbf{adjoint representation} of $G$.

\end{exam}

\begin{prop}
	The category $\Rep(G)$ is an abelian category and the forgetful functor $\Rep(G)\to \Vect_k$ is exact. 
\end{prop}

\begin{rem}
	If $V$ is finite-dimensional, then $\GL_V$ is represented by an algebraic group. A $G$-module structure on $V$ is just a homomorphism $G\to \GL_V$ between algebraic groups.
\end{rem}

\begin{warn}
	Evaluate at $k\in \CAlg_k$, we obtain a group homomorphism $G(k) \to \GL_V(k)=\GL(V)$. But a $G$-module structure contains more information than such a homomorphism. This can be seen from the following exercise. (Note that for $k=\mBC$, the \emph{abstract} groups $\mBG_\mba(\mBC)=\mBC$ and $\mBG_\mbm(\mBC)=\mBC^\times$ are isomorphic via the exponential map.)
\end{warn}


\begin{exe}
	This is \red{Homework 1, Problem 4}.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(1)]
			Find all maps between $k$-schemes $\mBA^1\to \mBA^1\setminus 0$.
		\item[(2)]
			Find all 1-dimensional representations of the additive group $\mBG_\mba$.
		\item[(3)]
			Find all maps between $k$-schemes $\mBA^1\setminus 0\to \mBA^1\setminus 0$.
		\item[(4)]
			Find all 1-dimensional representations of the multiplicative group $\mBG_\mbm$.
	\end{itemize}

\end{exe}

\begin{prop}
	Any $G$-action on a vector space $V$ is locally finite, i.e., $V$ is the union of its finite-dimensional subrepresentations.
\end{prop}


\begin{prop}
	There is a canonical equivalence
	\[
		\Rep(G) \simeq \mCO_G\mathsf{-comod}
	\]
	from the category of $G$-modules to the category of $\mCO_G$-comodules. This equivalence is compatible with the forgetful functors to $\Vect_k$.
\end{prop}

\begin{rem}
	The functor $\Rep(G) \simeq \mCO_G\mathsf{-comod}$ is constructed as follows. Let $V\in \Rep(G)$. Consider $A:=\mCO_G$ and the homomorphism $G(A) \to \GL_V(A)$. The identity map $G\to G$ can be written as $\Spec(A) \to G$ which corresponds to an element in $G(A)$\footnote{Warning: this is \emph{not} the unit element of this group.}. Consider the image of this element in $\GL_V(A)$, which is a $A$-linear map $A\ot V\to A\ot V$. This is the same as a $k$-linear map $V\to A\ot V$, i.e., a $k$-linear map
	\[
		V\to \mCO_G \ot V.
	\]
	One can verify this defines a $\mCO_G$-comodule structure on $V$.
\end{rem}

\begin{constr}
	There is a forgetful functor
	\[
		\Rep(G) \to \Lie(G)\hmod
	\]
	that can be constructed in the following equivalent ways:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
			Let we first suppose $V\in \Rep(G)$ is finite-dimensional. Then we have a homomorphism between algebraic groups $G\to \GL_V$ which induces a homomorphism between their Lie algebras $\Lie(G) \to \Lie(\GL_V) =\gl(V)$, i.e., a $\Lie(G)$-module structure on $V$.

			When $V$ is infinite-dimensional, the functor $\GL_V(-)$ is no longer represented by an algebraic group, but there is a formal method to define its Lie algebra and make the above construction work.
		\item
			Any $V\in \Rep(G)$ has an $\mCO_G$-comodule structure. By co-restricting along the map $\mCO_G \to \hat\mCO_G$, we obtain a (continuous) comodule structure for $\hat\mCO_G\simeq U(\mfg)^*$. Passing to duality, we obtain a module structure for $U(\mfg)$.

	\end{itemize}
\end{constr}


\begin{rem}
	On the level of $k$-points, the conjugate action of $G(k)$ on $G$ induces an (abstract) action of $G(k)$ on $\Lie(G)$. This can be generalized to an action of $G(A)$ on $A\ot\Lie(G)$ for any $A\in \CAlg_k$ and thereby obtain the desired $G$-module structure on $\Lie(G)$.
\end{rem}

\begin{prop}
	If $G$ is connected, then the functor $\Rep(G) \to \Lie(G)\hmod$ is fully faithful. In particular, the $G$-invariance and $\Lie(G)$-invariance for a $G$-module are the same. 
\end{prop}

\begin{defn}
	If $G$ is connected, we say an object $V\in \Lie(G)\hmod$ is \textbf{$G$-integrable} if it is contained in the essential image of the above functor.
\end{defn}

\begin{warn}
	The similar claim for derived categories is false. In other words, extensions of $G$-integrable modules are not necessarily $G$-integrable. The multiplicative group $\mBG_\mbm$ is a counterexample.
\end{warn}

\section{Semisimple Algebraic Groups}

\begin{thm}
	Any semisimple Lie algebra $\mfg$ can be realized as the Lie algebra of an algebraic group. In the category of connected algebraic groups $G$ with $\Lie(G)\simeq \mfg$, there is a final object $G_\ad$ and an initial object $G_\sc$. Moreover, the homomorphisms
	\[
		G_\sc \to G \to G_\ad
	\]
	are \emph{isogenies}, i.e., are surjective and have finite kernels.
\end{thm}

\begin{exam}
	For $\mfg=\sl_n$, we have $G_\sc=\SL_n$ and $G_\ad = \mathsf{PGL}_n$.
\end{exam}


\begin{defn}
	We say $G$ is \textbf{semisimple}\footnote{This is an ad hoc definition that only is only correct under our assumptions on $k$.} if it is connected and its Lie algebra is semisimple. For a semisimple algebraic group $G$, we say it is \textbf{of adjoint type} (resp. \textbf{simply connected}) if it is of the form $G_\ad$ (resp. $G_\sc$).
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
	If $G_\sc$ is a simply-connected semisimple algebraic group, then any finite-dimensional $\mfg$-module is $G_\sc$-integrable, i.e.,
	\[
		\Rep(G_\sc)_\mathsf{fd} = \mfg\hmod_\mathsf{fd}.
	\]
\end{thm}

\begin{warn}
	The similar claim for infinite-dimensional representation is false. This can be seen from the following exercise.
\end{warn}

\begin{exe}
	This is \red{Homework 1, Problem 5}. Let $G$ be any semisimple algebraic group with Lie algbra $\mfg$. Prove: any Verma module of $\mfg$ is not $G$-integrable.
\end{exe}


\begin{thm}
	Let $G$ be any semisimple algebraic group with Lie algebra $\mfg$. Then the abelian categories $\Rep(G)$ and $\mfg\hmod_\mathsf{fd}$ are semisimple\footnote{I.e., any object can be written as a direct sum of simple objects.}. Simple objects in $\Rep(G)$ are finite-dimensional, and an object $V\in \Rep(G)$ is simple iff it is an simple object in $\mfg\hmod$.

\end{thm}
