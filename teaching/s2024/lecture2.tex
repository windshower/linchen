\section{Universal enveloping algebra}

\begin{constr}
	Recall we have a forgetful functor $\mathsf{oblv}:\mathsf{Alg}_k \to \mathsf{Lie}_k$ from the category of associative algebras to that of Lie algebras. This functor admits a left adjoint
	\[
		U: \mathsf{Lie}_k \to \mathsf{Alg}_k
	\]
	that sends a Lie algebra $\mfg$ to the associative algebra
	\[
		U(\mfg) = T(\mfg)/\langle xy-yx-[x,y],\; x,y\in \mfg \rangle.
	\]
	Here 
	\[
		T(\mfg) := \bigoplus_{n\ge 0} \mfg^{\otimes n}
	\]
	is the tensor algebra of the underlying vector space of $\mfg$, and $\langle xy-yx-[x,y],\; x,y\in \mfg \rangle$ is the two-sided ideal generated by elements of the form $xy-yx-[x,y]$.

	The associative algebra $U(\mfg)$ is called the \textbf{universal enveloping algebra} of $\mfg$.
\end{constr}

Let $U(\mfg) \hmod$ be the abelian category of left modules for $U(\mfg)$.

\begin{lem}
	There is an equivalence
	\[
		\mfg\hmod \simeq U(\mfg) \hmod
	\]
	that commutes with forgetful functors to $\Vect_k$.
\end{lem}

\proof
	For a given vector space $V$, a $\mfg$-module structure on $V$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism $\mfg \to \oblv(\gl(V))$. By adjunction, this is the same as a homomorphism $U(\mfg) \to \gl(V)$, i.e., a left $U(\mfg)$-module structure on $V$.

\qed

\begin{constr}
	The tensor algebra $T(\mfg)$ is naturally \emph{graded}. But this grading does \emph{not} descent to $U(\mfg)$ because $xy-yx-[x,y]$ is not a homogenous element. Instead, $U(\mfg)$ has an exhausted filtration
	\[
		\mbF^{\le n} U(\mfg) := \mathsf{im}( \mbF^{\le n} T(\mfg) \to U(\mfg) )
	\]
	that is compatible with the algebra structure, i.e.,
	\[
		\mbF^{\le m} U(\mfg) \ot_k \mbF^{\le n} U(\mfg) \xrightarrow{\mathsf{mult}} \mbF^{\le {m+n}} U(\mfg) .
 	\]
 	Taking associated graded pieces, we obtain a graded algebra 
 	\[
 		\gr^\bullet U(\mfg) := \bigoplus_{n\ge 0} \mbF^{\le n} U(\mfg) / \mbF^{<n} U(\mfg).
 	\]

 	By the universal property of the tensor algebra, we have a unique homomorphism $T(\mfg) \to \gr^\bullet U(\mfg)$ whose restriction on $\mfg\subset T(\mfg)$ is the composition $\mfg \to \mbF^{\le 1}U(\mfg) \to \gr^1 U(\mfg) \subset \gr^\bullet U(\mfg)$. Denote this composition by $x\mapsto \bar{x}$. Note that we have $\bar{x}\bar{y} = \bar{y} \bar{x}$ as elements in $\gr^2U(\mfg)$ because the term $[x,y]$ is killed by the surjection $\mbF^{\le 2}U(\mfg) \to \gr^2 U(\mfg)$. It follows that we have a commutative diagram of surjective maps:
 	\[
 		\xymatrix{
 			T(\mfg) \ar@{->>}[r]^-{x\mapsto \bar{x}} \ar@{->>}[d] &
 			\gr^\bullet U(\mfg) \\
 			\Sym(\mfg), \ar@{.>>}[ru]_-\phi
 		}
 	\]
 	where $\Sym(\mfg):= T(\mfg)/\langle xy-yx \rangle $ is the \emph{symmetric algebra} of $\mfg$. In particular, $\gr^\bullet U(\mfg)$ is a commutative algebra.

\end{constr}

\begin{rem}
	Note that $\gr^\bullet U(\mfg)$ being commutative is equivalent to $[\mbF^i U(\mfg), \mbF^j U(\mfg)] \subset \mbF^{i+j-1} U(\mfg)$, where we write $\mbF^{-n}U(\mfg)=0$ for $n>0$.

\end{rem}

\begin{thm}[Poincar√©--Birkhoff--Witt, a.k.a. PBW]
 	For any Lie algebra $\mfg$, the above homomorphism $\phi:\Sym(\mfg)\to  \gr^\bullet U(\mfg)$ is an isomorphism.
\end{thm}

\begin{cor}
	\label{cor-basis-Ug}
	Let $\{x_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a basis of $\mfg$ as a vector space. Choose a total order on the set $I$. Then the set 
	$\{ x_{i_1}^{m_1} x_{i_2}^{m_2} \cdots x_{i_n}^{m_n} \,\vert\, n\ge 0, i_1<i_2<\cdots <i_n, m_1,m_2,\dots,m_n\in \mBZ^{>0} \}$ is a basis of the vector space $U(\mfg)$.
\end{cor}

\begin{cor}
	If $\mfg$ is a finite-dimensional algebra, then $U(\mfg)$ is left and right Noetherian. 
\end{cor}

\proof
	A filtered ring $A$ is left (resp. right) Noetherian if its assoicated graded ring $\gr^\bullet A$ is so. See \cite[Chapter 1, Theorem 6.9]{MR}\footnote{Sketch: a left ideal $I\subset A$ defines a left ideal $\gr^\bullet I\subset \gr^\bullet A$ with $\gr^n I= ((I + \mbF^{n-1}A) \cap \mbF^nA)/\mbF^{n-1}A$. This assignment is injective.}.
\qed

\section{Verma modules}

From now on, we fix a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra $\mfg$ and choose $\mft\subset\mfb \subset \mfg$, i.e., a Cartain subalgebra and a Borel subalgebra of it. Recall we have $\mfg = \mfn^- \oplus \mft \oplus \mfn$, $\mfb = \mft\oplus \mfn$, $\mft\simeq \mfb/\mfn$ and $\mfn = [\mfb,\mfb]$\footnote{We didn't mention the last one in the last lecture, but it follows easily from the root decomposition.}.

\begin{constr}
	The projection $\mfb \to \mft$ induces a restriction functor $\mft\hmod \to \mfb\hmod$. Note that we have 
	\begin{equation} \label{eqn-Fourier}
		\mft\hmod \simeq U(\mft)\hmod \simeq \Sym(\mft)\hmod \simeq \QCoh(\mft^*).
	\end{equation}
	Hence for any $\lambda\in \mft^*$, the skyscrapter sheaf at $\lambda$ gives a 1-dimensional representation
	\[
		k_\lambda \in \mft\hmod.
	\]
	In other words, for $x\in \mft$, its action on $k_\lambda$ is given by the scaler $\lambda(x)$.

	We abuse notation and write $k_\lambda$ for the corresponding object in $\mfb\hmod$.
\end{constr}

\begin{rem}
	Note that any 1-dimensional $\mfb$-module $V$ is of the form $k_\lambda$. Indeed, the Lie homomorphism $\mfb \to \gl(V)$ must kill $\mfn=[\mfb,\mfb]$ because $\gl(V)$ is abelian.

\end{rem}

\begin{defn}
	Consider the restriction functor $\mfg\hmod \to \mfb\hmod$ and its left adjoint
	\[
		\ind_\mfb^\mfg: \mfb\hmod\to \mfg\hmod.
	\]
	For any weight $\lambda\in \mft^*$, we define the \textbf{Verma module} to be
	\[
		M_\lambda := \ind_\mfb^\mfg( k_\lambda ) \in \mfg\hmod.
	\]

\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
Explicitly, we have
\[
	M_\lambda \simeq U(\mfg)\ot_{U(\mfb)} k_\lambda.
\]
In particular, $M_\lambda$ is infinite-dimensional.
\end{rem}

\begin{defn}
	By adjunction, there is a $\mfb$-linear map $k_\lambda\to M_\lambda$ corresponding to the identity morphism $M_\lambda\to M_\lambda$ in $\mfg\hmod$. After fixing a nonzero vector $1_\lambda$ of $k_\lambda$, we obtain a vector $v_\lambda \in M_\lambda$. We call it a \textbf{highest weight vector} of $M_\lambda$.
\end{defn}

The meaning of this name will be explained shortly. Note that by definition, $\mfn\cdot v_\lambda=0$ and $v_\lambda$ is a $\lambda$-eigenvector for the $\mft$-action.

\begin{exe}\label{exe-Verma}
	This is \red{Homework 1, Problem 1}. Prove:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(1)]
			The map
			\[
				U(\mfn^-) \ot_k U (\mfb) \xrightarrow{\mathsf{mult}} U(\mfg)
			\]
			is an isomorphism between $(U(\mfn^-) , U (\mfb))$-bimodules.
		\item[(2)]
			As an $\mfn^-$-module, $M_\lambda$ is freely generated by $v_\lambda$, i.e.,
			\[
				U(\mfn^-) \to M_\lambda,\; x \mapsto x\cdot v_\lambda
			\]
			is an isomorphism.
	\end{itemize}
\end{exe}

As a contrary, we have:

\begin{lem}
	The $\mfn$-action on $M_\lambda$ is locally finite.
\end{lem}

\proof
	By the above exercise, we have $M_\lambda = \bigcup_i \mbF^i U(\mfg)\cdot v_\lambda$, where $F^\bullet U(\mfg)$ is the PBW filtration on $U(\mfg)$. Each $ \mbF^i U(\mfg)\cdot v_\lambda$ is finite dimensional. Hence we only need to show these subspaces are $\mfn$-stable. For $u\in \mbF^i U(\mfg)$ and $x\in \mfn$ we have
	\[
		x\cdot (u\cdot v_\lambda) = u\cdot (x\cdot v_\lambda) + [x,u]\cdot v_\lambda. 
	\]
	By definition $x\cdot v_\lambda=0$. Then we win because $[x,u]\in [\mfg, \mbF^i U(\mfg)] \subset \mbF^{i-1} U(\mfg)$.

\qed


We are going to describe the $\mft$-action on $M_\lambda$. We need some definitions.

\begin{defn}
	Let $V\in \mft\hmod$. We say $V$ is a \textbf{weight module} if $V = \oplus_{\lambda\in \mft^*} V_\lambda$, where $V_\lambda\subset V$ is the $\lambda$-eigenspace. We say $\lambda$ is a \textbf{weight} of $V$ if $V_\lambda\neq 0$. Vectors in $V_\lambda$ are called \textbf{$\lambda$-weight vectors}.
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
	A $\mft$-module $V$ is a weight module iff the action is locally finite and semisimple. This means for any $v\in V$, the subspace $\mft\cdot v$ is finite-dimensional and any $x\in \mft$ is sent to a diagonalizable endomorphism in $\gl(\mft\cdot v)$.
\end{rem}

\begin{rem}
	\label{rem-weight-module-qcoh}
	A $\mft$-module is a weight module iff the corresponding quasi-coherent sheaf on $\mft^*$ is a direct sum of 1-dimensional skyscrapters at closed points.
\end{rem}

\begin{exam}
	By the root decomposition, $\mfg$ is a weight module when viewed as a $\mft$-module via the adjoint action. Nonzero weights are roots.
\end{exam}

\begin{exam}
	The object $U(\mft)\in \mft\hmod$ is not a weight module. Indeed, it corresponds to the structure sheaf of $\mft^*$.
\end{exam}

\begin{rem}
	\label{rem-weight-module-subq}
	Weight modules in $\mft\hmod$ are closed under taking subquotients (e.g. by Remark \ref{rem-weight-module-qcoh}), but not closed under extensions.
\end{rem}

\begin{prop}
	\label{prop-Verma-weight}
	The Verma module $M_\lambda$ is a weight module, and the weights are given exactly by
	\[
		\lambda - \sum_{\alpha\in \Phi^+} n_\alpha \alpha,\; n_\alpha \in \mBZ^{\ge 0}.
	\]
	Moreover, each weight space is finite-dimensional.
\end{prop}

\proof
	First, note that $v_\lambda \in M_\lambda$ is a $\lambda$-weight vector because it is the image of $1_\lambda \in k_\lambda$.

	By the PBW theorem (Corollary \ref{cor-basis-Ug}), $U(\mfn^-)$ has a basis consists of weight vectors whose weights are $- \sum_{\alpha\in \Phi^+} n_\alpha \alpha,\; n_\alpha \in \mBZ^{\ge 0}$. Also, each weight space is finite dimensional.

	Let $x\in U(\mfn^-)$ be such a weight vector and $\mu$ be its weight. By the following equation, $x\cdot v_\lambda\in M_\lambda$ is a $(\lambda+\mu)$-weight vector:
	\[
		t\cdot (x\cdot v_\lambda) = x\cdot (t\cdot v_\lambda) + [t,x]\cdot v_\lambda,\; t\in \mft.
	\]
	Then we win by Exercise \ref{exe-Verma}.

\qed

\begin{defn}
	We define a partial order $\preceq$ on $\mft^*$ such that $\mu_1\preceq \mu_2$ iff $\mu_2-\mu_1 \in \mBZ^{\ge 0}\Phi^+$.
\end{defn}

Note that under the above partial order, the weight of $v_\lambda\in M_\lambda$ is indeed the highest one.


\begin{exam}
	Consider the case $\mfg=\sl_2$ equipped with its standard Cartan and Borel subalgebras. A weight $\lambda\in \mft^*$ is the same as a scaler $l:= \langle \lambda,\check \alpha\rangle $, where $ \check \alpha := h:= \big(\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & -1\end{smallmatrix}\big)\in \mft$ is the coroot. 

	Since $\langle \alpha,\check \alpha\rangle =2$, the weights of the Verma module $M_l$ are of the form $l-2n$, $n\ge 0$. For each such $l':=l-2n$, since $\mfn^-$ is 1-dimensional, the $l'$-weight space of $M_l$ is also 1-dimensional. Namely, it is spaned by $f^n\cdot v_l\in M_l$, where $f:=  \big(\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 0\\ 1 & 0\end{smallmatrix}\big)$ generates $\mfn^-$.

\end{exam}

\begin{exe}
	This is \red{Homework 1, Problem 2}\footnote{Warning: the solution in Gaitsgory's notes contains a critical typo and the last paragraph there should be justified. Also, don't forget to show $L_l$ is irreducible.
	}. 
	In the case $\mfg=\sl_2$, show the Verma module $M_l$ is irreducible unless $l\in \mBZ^{\ge 0}$. In the latter case, show there is a non-split short exact sequence 
	\begin{equation} \label{eqn-sl2}
		0 \to M_{-l-2} \to M_l \to L_l \to 0
	\end{equation}
	such that $L_l$ is a finite-dimensional irreducible $\sl_2$-module with highest weight $l$.
\end{exe}

\begin{comment}
\proof
	We only need to classify all submodules of $M_l$. Suppose $M_l$ contains a proper nonzero submodule $N$. Then $N$ is a weight module. Let $l'$ be the highest weight of $N$. By the previous discussion, $l'=l-2n$, $n>0$, and $v_{l'}:=f^n\cdot v_l$ is a weight vector.

	A direct calculation shows $e\cdot v_{l'}$ is a $(l'+2)$-weight vector, where $e:= \big(\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 1\\ 0 & 0\end{smallmatrix}\big)$ generates $\mfn$. Hence we must have $e\cdot v_{l'}=0$. We have
	\[
		0 = e \cdot f^n\cdot v_l 
		= \sum_{1\le i\le n} f^{n-i} \cdot [e,f] \cdot f^{i-1} \cdot v_l + f^n \cdot e\cdot v_l.
	\]
	Note that $e\cdot v_l=0$. Also, $[e,f]=h$ and $h\cdot f^j = f^j \cdot h -2j f^{j}.$ We obtain
	\[
		0 = \sum_{1\le i\le n} ( f^{n-1} \cdot h - 2(i-1) f^{n-1} )\cdot v_l = n(l-n+1) f^{n-1}\cdot v_l.
	\]
	Note that $f^{n-1}\cdot v_l\neq 0$ because $f^n\cdot v_l\neq 0$. Hence we must have $l=n-1$ and $l'=-l-2$.

	This shows $M_l$ is irreducible unless $l\in \mBZ^{\ge 0}$. In the latter case, $M_l$ has a unique proper nonzero submodule $N$, and the highest weight of $N$ is $-l-2$. Since $e\cdot v_{-l-2}=0$, we have a nonzero $\mfb$-linear map $k^{-l-2} \to N$ given by the vector $v_{-l-2}$. By adjunction, we obtain a nonzero $\mfg$-linear map $M_{-l-2} \to N$. We have already shown $M_{-l-2}$ is irreducible, hence this map is injective. Then it is an isomorphism by the uniqueness of the submodule $N$. Now the quotient $L_l:=M_l/M_{-l-2}$ has weights $-l,-l+2,\cdots,l$ and each weight space is 1-dimensional. Hence $V_l$ is finite-dimensional. It is irreducible because the uniqueness of the submodule $N$.




\qed
\end{comment}

We return to the study of general semisimple Lie algebra $\mfg$.

\begin{thm}
	The Verma module $M_\lambda$ admits a unique irreducible quotient module $L_\lambda$, and the highest weight of $L_\lambda$ is $\lambda$. In particular, $L_\lambda$ and $L_\lambda'$ are non-isomorphic for $\lambda\neq \lambda'$.
\end{thm}

\proof
	Any proper submodule $N\subset M_\lambda$ is a weight module whose weights do not contain $\lambda$. It follows that the union of all the proper submodules satisfies the same property. By construction, this is the maximal proper submodule of $M_\lambda$. Then $L_\lambda$ is the corresponding quotient.

\qed

\section{Category \texorpdfstring{$\mCO$}{O}}

Roughly speaking, the Bernstein--Gelfand--Gelfand (a.k.a. BGG) category $\mCO$ is the full subcategory of $\mfg\hmod$ consisting of objects similar to Verma modules. Let us first give the traditional definition:

\begin{defn}
	We define the \textbf{category $\mCO$} to be the full subcategory of $\mfg\hmod$ consisting of objects $M$ satisfying the following properties:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(O1)] $M$ is finitely generated as a $\mfg$-module;
		\item[(O2)] $M$ is a weight module;
		\item[(O3)] The action of $\mfn$ on $M$ is locally finite.
	\end{itemize}

\end{defn}

\begin{exam}
	We have already seen that the Verma modules $M_\lambda\in \mCO$.
\end{exam}

\begin{lem}
	The subcategory $\mCO$ of $\mfg\hmod$ is closed under taking sub-quotients and finite direct sums. In particular, $\mCO$ is an abelian category.
\end{lem}

\proof
	For (O1), $U(\mfg)$ is Noetherian. For (O2), Remark \ref{rem-weight-module-subq}. The claim for (O3) is obvious. 
\qed



\begin{warn}
	The subcategory $\mCO$ is \emph{not} closed under extensions. This can be seen by considering $\ind_\mfb^\mfg(N)$ where $N$ is a finite dimensional $\mft$-module that does not have a weight decomposition.
\end{warn}

\begin{lem}
	Any object $M\in \mCO$ is Noetherian, i.e., satisfies the ascending chain condition for subobjects.
\end{lem}

\proof
	Follows from the fact that $U(\mfg)$ is Noetherian.
\qed


\begin{prop} \label{prop-Verma-generate}
	Any object $M\in \mCO$ is a quotient of a finite successive extension of Verma modules. In particular, $M$ is finitely generated as an $\mfn^-$-module.
\end{prop}

\proof
	The last claim follows from the first one because of Exercise \ref{exe-Verma}.

	By (O1), $M$ is generated by a finite-dimensional subspace $M_0$ as a $\mfg$-module. By (O2), we can enlarge $M_0$ and assumme it is a finite direct sum of weight spaces. By (O3), $U(\mfb)\cdot M_0 = U(\mfn)\cdot M_0$ is finite-dimensional. Hence we may assume $M_0$ is stable under the $\mfb$-action. By adjunction, we have a $\mfg$-linear map
	\[
		\ind_\mfb^\mfg( M_0 ) \to M,
	\]
	which is surjective because $M_0$ generates $M$ as a $\mfg$-module. It remains to show $M_0$ is a successive extension of 1-dimensional $\mfb$-modules. We state this as the following lemma.

\begin{lem}
	Let $M\in \mCO$ and $M_0\subset M$ be a finite-dimensional subspace stable under the $\mfb$-action. Then the $\mfn$-action on $M_0$ is nilpotent and $M_0$ is a successive extension of 1-dimensional $\mfb$-modules.
\end{lem}

\proof
	Note that the second claim follows from the first one. Namely, let $N_0\subset M_0$ be the subspace annihilated by $\mfn$. This is a sub-$\mfb$-representation because $\mfn$ is an ideal of $\mfb$. The first claim implies $N_0\neq 0$. Since $N_0$ is annihilated by $\mfn$, it is in the image of the restriction functor $\mft\hmod \to \mfb\hmod$. It follows that $N_0$ is a direct sum of 1-dimensional $\mfb$-representations because it is a weight module. Replacing $M_0$ by $M_0/N_0$, we win by induction.

	It remains to prove the first claim. We only need to show $\mfn$ acts nilpotently on any weight vector $v\in M_0$. Let $x\in \mfn$ be a weight vector. A direct calculation shows $x\cdot v$ is a weight vector whose weight is the sum of those of $v$ and $x$. In particular, the weight of $x\cdot v$ is strictly greater than that of $v$ with respect to the partial order $\prec$. Since the set of weights of $M_0$ is finite, we see $\mfn$ acts nilpotently on $v$.

\qed

\qed[Proposition \ref{prop-Verma-generate}]

\begin{cor}
	Let $M\in \mCO$. Then each weight space of $M$ is finite-dimensional.
\end{cor}

\proof
	Follows from Proposition \ref{prop-Verma-weight} and Proposition \ref{prop-Verma-generate}.

\qed

\begin{exe}
	This is \red{Homework 1, Problem 3}. Recall for any $V_1,V_2\in \mfg\hmod$, the tensor product $V_1\ot V_2$ of the underlying vector spaces has a natural $\mfg$-module structure defined by $x\cdot (v_1\ot v_2):= (x\cdot v_1)\ot v_2 + v_1\ot(x\cdot v_2)$. 

	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(1)]
			Prove: if $V_1$ and $V_2$ are weight modules, so is $V_1\ot V_2$. Determine the weights and weight spaces of $V_1\ot V_2$ in term of those for $V_1$ and $V_2$.
		\item[(2)]
			Consider the case $\mfg=\sl_2$. Prove: the tensor product of two Verma modules is not contained in $\mCO$.
	\end{itemize}
